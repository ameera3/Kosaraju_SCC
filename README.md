# Kosaraju_SCC

## Usage
To compile, type "make". To run the program, type "./kosaraju File" where File contains 
a list of edges of a directed graph. Every row indicates an edge, the vertex label in first 
column is the tail and the vertex label in second column is the head.

## Introduction

 The command line program kosaraju.cpp takes in one parameter, an input file
 name. The input file specified by the input file name should contain a list 
 of its edges. Every row indicates an edge, the vertex label in first column 
 is the tail and the vertex label in second column is the head. The program 
 will run [Kosaraju's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm)
 and output the size of the five largest strongly connected components.
